- ⚡ Fun fact: Octopuses have three hearts! Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Even more fascinating, when an octopus swims, the heart that pumps blood to the body temporarily stops, which is why they prefer crawling over swimming to conserve energy. 🐙
